# Trello Zeit Integration

**Warning:** This project is currently just a show case.
You can use as a base if you are familiar with how to create a
Zeit Integration and a little bit with the Trello API.

## How to build

* Replace the `TRELLO_API_KEY` with your [**Trello API-KEY**](https://trello.com/app-key)
* Replace the `TRELLO_USERNAME` with your **Trello username**

Now you should be able to use this code in your Zeit Integration.
